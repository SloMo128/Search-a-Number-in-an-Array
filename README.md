# Search a Number in an Array 🔍

This Java program allows the user to enter a fixed set of numbers and then search for a specific value inside the array using a linear search algorithm.
The program reports whether the number is found and displays its position.

## Features
- Searches for a number inside an integer array
- Uses a linear search algorithm
- Displays the position of the searched number if found
- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand

## How it works
The program uses:
- Scanner to read user input
- An array to store integer values
- A for loop to scan the array
- A boolean flag to track whether the number is found
- Basic conditionals (if) to compare values

## Learning Purpose
This project is intended for learning purposes, especially for beginners practicing:
- Arrays
- Loops (for)
- Conditional statements
- User input handling in Java
- Basic search algorithms
